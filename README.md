# WHAT IS THIS PROJECT

This project was part of our team (Team Not Found) for the HACKSUS'23 , conducted at RSET.
This project is a proof on concept for our idea of a real-time database of tracking bus locations.

# WHAT DID WE USE?

We used python , html and css.
We used **FLASK** to create a web app to serve our website and later on packaged the website using react-native into an end user application.
We also incorporated a firebase RealTimeDataBase to store the location of busses using python itself to meet the problem statements.

Unfortunately no, but on the postivie side this has given our team the opportunity to work on ourselves and to improve and evolve the idea into something bigger and better.
